# Hack Arizona
The largest Hackathon in the Southwest! 
Hack AZ participants can now navigate all of the events much easier by way of:
  * Having the schedule at the palm of their hands
  * Access to maps of the venue to better navigate where sponsor tables are
  * Push Notifications when each event starts
  * Much more!
  
## Notes

Those who clone or fork the repo will need to:

  * Remove the GoogleService-Info.plist
  * Setup Firebase for the Push Notification Serivce
  * Install Alamofire, Alamofire_Synchronous and SwiftyJSON using CocoaPods or user preference (See Built With below for links to these frameworks)

Optional:

We are using JSON files for our data that are hosted on our website www.hackarizona.org. 
We recommened doing the same as this app is aleady setup for this, and all that would need to be changed are links and a the methods that grab the data
