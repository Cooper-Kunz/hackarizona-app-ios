# Hack Arizona
The largest Hackathon in the Southwest! 
Hack AZ participants can now navigate all of the events much easier by way of having the schedule at the palm of their hands, access to maps of the venue to better navigate where sponsor tables are, notifications when each event starts, and much more!

## Notes

1. Remove the GoogleService-Info.plist
2. Setup Firebase for the Push Notification Serivce
3. Install Alamofire, Alamofire_Synchronous and SwiftyJSON using CocoaPods or user preference (See Built With below for links to these frameworks)
